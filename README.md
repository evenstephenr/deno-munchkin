# deno-munchkin

`deno-munchkin` is a text-only turn-based strategy game where you have to deal with constraints to fight your way out of a sketchy dungeon. It is not-that-loosely based on the board game [Munchkin](https://munchkin.game/).

> For bug reports or feature requests, please open an issue on this project!

## Why deno?

[deno](https://deno.land) is a new, interesting way to write Typescript (and Javascript) services and CLI-based utilities. As somebody who prefers to write Typescript before Javascript, I really like the Deno DX for now :)

## How to play

After setup, you can run the app locally to play! Inside your terminal, you can input a number that maps to an action to select it. Good luck!

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repo

2. [Make sure you have Deno installed](https://deno.land/#installation)

3. Inside the project directory, run the command `deno run main.ts`

4. You should see some output in the terminal that looks like this

```
$ deno run main.ts
Check ~/deno-munchkin/main.ts
Welcome to the game, Player

Choose an action


[0]: Knock on the door
[1]: Inspect your gear

```
